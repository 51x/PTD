Question ideas for full black box penetration test phases
=======

- Online resources available against the target? (websites, services, social networks)

- Active enumeration start, any protections (eg. WAF or DBFW)?

- Port scan and fingerprinting? Identified background services (eg. if its a webapp, what's behind (load balancer, nginx, apache, python)?)

- How things connect together? Full picture of currently collected info/topology?  

- Default passwords or weak passwords used for auth?

- Do we need to / can we create a virtual copy of the attacked systems? (may it be required later for exploit development?)

- Automatic scanning done?

- Any login details, default passwords? Any upload possibilities (eg. wp shell or other addon)?

- Manual testing for vulns done?

- List of possible attack surfaces, evasion (if needed) and vulnerabilities?

- Social engineering?
      - Sending emails?
      - Phone calls?
      - Contact through social media?

- Looks exploitable, but shell does not come back?
      - Using the touch command on web server to see if it really works?
      - DNS tunneling?
      - DoS (be careful to not break production!)?

- Got shell? Windows? Linux?

  - Security related software checks?
      - On Windows, examples: antivirus, EMET (or other anti-exploitation software), applocker, powershell or it's functions locked, logging?
      - On Linux, examples: antivirus, Grsec/Pax, apparmor, SELinux, auditd, remote logging, keyloggers?

  - What can we do with Windows?
      - Admin already? Local priv esc vulns?
      - Readable files with passwords or crackable?
      - SAM dump (hive, local)?
      - Copy SAM database from backup?
      - Cachedump (security hive, domain, more complicated)?
      - LSASS dump (memory)?
      - Tokens? Impersonation?
      - WMI?
      - Misconfigured services?
      - Tickets (Kerberos)?
      - Wrong permissions? System running world writable files?
      - Bypass of functions (eg. applocker bypasses)?
      - Local privilege escalation exploits?
      - Other users and their interaction?
       
  - What can we do with Linux?
      - Root already? Local priv esc vulns?
      - sudo (su)?
      - Readable files with passwords or crackable?
      - /etc/passwd users?
      - Wrong permissions? Guid/suid? rwxrwxrwx?
      - Misconfigured services?
      - Bypass of functions (eg. apparmor bypass)?
      - Local privilege escalation exploits?
      - Other users and their interaction (eg. X hacking)?
     

Note: it's not a good idea to take it as a checklist and think the pentest is done. These are better to be considered as some kind of minimum requirements which should be answerable.
